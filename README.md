# Talk.2024.AnatomyInternalSeminar

My talk for the internal seminar at the Institute of Anatomy on January 18, 2024.

[The last time](https://github.com/habi/Talk.2020.AnatomyInternalSeminar), I spoke about many human teeth.
This time, I'm speaking about *many* more teeth, but from fishes.
I speak about [doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0291003](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291003) and a bit about the `cox7a` project with [Nadias group](https://www.ana.unibe.ch/research/developmental_biology_and_regeneration/).
