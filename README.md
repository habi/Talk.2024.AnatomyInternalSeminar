# Talk.2024.AnatomyInternalSeminar

My talk for the internal seminar at the Institute of Anatomy on September 19, 2024.

[The last time](https://github.com/habi/Talk.2020.AnatomyInternalSeminar), I spoke about many human teeth.
This time, I'm speaking about *many* more teeth, but from fishes.
I speak about [doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0291003](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291003) and [doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2024.04.012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2024.04.012).
